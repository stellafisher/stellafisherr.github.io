<h1><strong>My Favorite things in Madison, Wisconsin</strong></h1>
	

		<p>Madison is the greatest place to spend your college years. The food is amazing and the opportunities are endless! One of my favorite memories here in Madison is jumping in the lake after winter. It was freezing cold, but definitely an experience I will never forget!</p>

		<h2><strong>Below is a picture of my roommate and I jumping in Lake Mendota!</strong></h2>
